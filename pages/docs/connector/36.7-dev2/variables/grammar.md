#### Instance Data
Every `connector` has a `variables.alan` file where a set of key value-type pairs is specified.
The connector requires a `values.json` instance data file, this provides the value (of the correct type) for each of these keys.
The `values.json` file is required and must also be provided when no keys are specified.
During deployments the runtime validates the provided values and fails when either:

* a value is missing
* a value is of the wrong type
* a superfluous value is present

To help with ensuring a correct `values.json` file before deployments, the `values-helper` tool is provided.
This can be run from any project with the follow command:

```
./.alan/devenv/system-types/connector/scripts/generate_values.sh <Path-To-System> <Path-To-Deployment>

Example: ./.alan/devenv/system-types/connector/scripts/generate_values.sh systems/currency-importer ./deployment/demo
```

The tool is interactive and always prompts the user before deleting any data from an existing `values.json`.
Once a new version of `values.json` has been written, which is guaranteed to be accepted by the server, the following message is printed:

```
Values successfully updated
```
#### Variables
The variables.
Each has a type of `integer` or `text`.
The values of each variable is specified in the deployment, see Instance Data.
