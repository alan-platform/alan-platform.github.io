In Alan data models drive everything.
The unique application modeling language allows you to write a model that generates both a database design and a user interface. It's a fast way to create and iterate on your application, without sacrificing data correctness.


## M-industries
M-industries built the Alan platform to help international businesses like Tata Steel and Hydro improve data quality and upgrade their legacy systems.
We're based near the campus of Delft University of Technology and you can find us here:

## The platform
Alan is a full stack platform. It runs on a custom minimal Linux distro and includes (among other things) data and file storage, server-side report generator, an sql-compatible dump service, and a web based client. 

The datastore is fully push based, ensuring all connected clients always have the most up to date data. 

It's Alan all the way down: we use it for domain specific languages to create models that drive code generation and provide solid internal API's to develop our systems. This makes us super efficient: all components and systems in the platform together are only about 360k lines of code.
