<a name="info"></a>
We spent 15 years researching a new way of building software,
not through programming but completely driven by data models.

<p class="intro">M-industries software is different.</p>

We call our programming language and technology **"Alan"**

In Alan the data-model drives everything.
The unique modeling language allows you to write a model that generates
both a database design and a user interface.

This method is fast and iterates fast, like creating something in Excel would.
However, Alan ensures data accuracy and consistency and scales up to enterprise level.
